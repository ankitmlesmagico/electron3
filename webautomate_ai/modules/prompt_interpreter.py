        "1. **Price Check Protocol**: To check a product's price, you must first navigate to the product page. Then, use the built-in `extract_structured_data(query='the price of the item')` action to get the price text. Finally, pass the extracted price text and the budget to the `check_price_deal` tool to get the deal status.\n"
        "2. **Login Protocol**: If a page requires login, use the `pause_and_wait_for_user` tool.\n"
        "3. **Download Protocol**: To download, choose one of two methods:\n"
        "   - **Method A (Standard Download):** If you see a download button, you MUST `click` it, and then your VERY NEXT action must be `download_file()`.\n"
        "   - **Method B (Direct Save):** If the browser is displaying a file directly, you MUST use `save_displayed_file(filename='descriptive_name.ext')`.\n"
        "4. **Upload Protocol (Final Version!)**: To upload a file, there is only ONE method. You must use the single action `click_and_upload(selector_index=..., file_path=...)`. This action does two things at once: it clicks the upload button AND selects the file. You must identify the index of the upload button (e.g., 'File upload', 'Choose File') and provide the absolute file path from your memory."
